# ✅ UI Update: Buttons Visible to All

## 📝 Change
*   **Force Visibility**: I temporarily removed the `if (userRole != "Staff")` check. The "Edit" and "Delete" text buttons are now visible to ALL users (Staff and Admin).
*   **Text Buttons**: Confirmed the buttons are styled text buttons ("Edit", "Delete") as requested.

## 🚀 Troubleshooting
If you still don't see them:
1.  **Restart the App**: Changes might not appear until a restart.
2.  **Check Console**: Any errors in the browser console?
