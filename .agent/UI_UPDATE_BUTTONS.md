# ✅ UI Update: Text Buttons

## 📝 Change
*   **Replaced Icons with Text**: The "Edit" and "Delete" actions in the Recent Sales table now use text buttons instead of icons, as requested.
*   **Styling**: Applied `text-xs`, borders, and hover effects to make them look like sleek buttons while keeping the text clear.

## 🚀 Status
The update is applied to `Sales.razor`. You can verify by running the app.
