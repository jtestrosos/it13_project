# ✅ Staff Access Enabled

## 🔓 Access Unlocked
*   **Recent Sales Transactions**: The "Edit" and "Delete" actions are now visible and functional for users with the **"Staff"** role.
*   **Verification**: I confirmed that there are no hidden specific checks in the C# code preventing Staff from performing these actions.

## 🛠️ How to Test
1.  Log in as a "Staff" user.
2.  Go to the Sales page.
3.  You should see the "Edit" and "Delete" buttons in the "Recent Sales Transactions" table.
